/**
 * Bit Iterating implementation of {@link Spliterator} that is meant to be used
 * in conjunction with {@link BitSet}s. This class allows for parallel
 * processing on the indices of a {@link BitSet} such that those operations will
 * never enter race conditions on the underlying longs within
 * {@link BitSet#words}. This behavior can only be guaranteed if the indices
 * returned by the {@link Biterator} are manipulated, and not some offset or
 * translation. This bounding of indices to specific threads is necessary
 * because of the non-atomic nature of modifying a long. Using a generic
 * parallel {@link IntStream} would cause changes to the underlying long words
 * of a {@link BitSet} to be potentially overridden by other threads
 * manipulating nearby bits.
